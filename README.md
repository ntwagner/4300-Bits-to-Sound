# 4300-Bits-to-Sound
This is the project for our 4300 class. It incorporates the instructions associated with a processor (add, sub, mult etc) and lets a user's input be converted to sound.

The docx file describes the overall process of converting an 8-bit integer value into a counter that drives the creation of square waves. These square waves create sound when a low enough frequency is achieved.
